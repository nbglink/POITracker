# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, contact the repository owner directly with:
- a description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- any relevant logs or screenshots

## Scope

This project is intended to run locally on Windows and can execute trades via MetaTrader 5 when explicitly enabled.
Treat API endpoints as sensitive and do not expose the backend port to the public internet.
